# Phone Number Location and Carrier Information

This Python project utilizes the `phonenumbers` and `folium` packages to determine and visualize key details about a phone number. Specifically, it extracts the following information:

- **Country and State**: The location where the number is registered.
- **Carrier**: The telecommunications provider for the number.
- **Latitude and Longitude**: Geographical coordinates of the location.
- **Timezone**: The time zone of the location.

The project outputs this information and generates an interactive map to visualize the phone number's location.

## Features

- **Location Identification**: Determine the country and state of the phone number.
- **Carrier Information**: Identify the telecommunications provider.
- **Geolocation**: Retrieve latitude and longitude coordinates.
- **Timezone Detection**: Find the time zone of the location.
- **Interactive Map**: Use Folium to create a map displaying the phone number's location.

## Requirements

- `phonenumbers`
- `folium`

## Usage

Simply input a phone number to get the details and visualize its location on the map.
